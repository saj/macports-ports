description         general-purpose libraries for C system programming

long_description \
    skalibs is a package centralizing the free software / open source \
    C development files used for building all software at skarnet.org: \
    it contains essentially general-purpose libraries. skalibs can \
    also be used as a sound basic start for C development. There are a \
    lot of general-purpose libraries out there\; but if your main goal \
    is to produce small and secure C code with a focus on system \
    programming, skalibs might be for you.
