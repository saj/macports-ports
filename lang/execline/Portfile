description         non-interactive scripting language

long_description \
    execline is a (non-interactive) scripting language, like sh - but \
    its syntax is quite different from a traditional shell syntax. The \
    execlineb program is meant to be used as an interpreter for a text \
    file\; the other commands are essentially useful inside an \
    execlineb script. execline is as powerful as a shell: it features \
    conditional loops, getopt-style option handling, filename \
    globbing, and more. Meanwhile, its syntax is far more logic and \
    predictable than the shell's syntax, and has no security issues.
