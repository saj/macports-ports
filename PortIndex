The execlineb program is meant to be used as an interpreter for a text {file;} the other commands are essentially useful inside an execlineb script. execline is as powerful as a shell: it features conditional loops, getopt-style option handling, filename globbing, and more. Meanwhile, its syntax is far more logic and predictable than the shell's syntax, and has no security issues.} version 2.8.0.1 categories lang revision 0
