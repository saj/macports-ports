There are a lot of general-purpose libraries out {there;} but if your main goal is to produce small and secure C code with a focus on system programming, skalibs might be for you.} version 2.10.0.3 categories devel revision 0

The execlineb program is meant to be used as an interpreter for a text {file;} the other commands are essentially useful inside an execlineb script. execline is as powerful as a shell: it features conditional loops, getopt-style option handling, filename globbing, and more. Meanwhile, its syntax is far more logic and predictable than the shell's syntax, and has no security issues.} version 2.8.0.1 categories lang revision 0
