description         toolbox for low-level process and service administration

long_description \
    s6 is a small suite of programs for UNIX, designed to allow \
    process supervision (a.k.a service supervision), in the line of \
    daemontools and runit, as well as various operations on processes \
    and daemons. It is meant to be a toolbox for low-level process and \
    service administration, providing different sets of independent \
    tools that can be used within or without the framework, and that \
    can be assembled together to achieve powerful functionality with \
    a very small amount of code.
